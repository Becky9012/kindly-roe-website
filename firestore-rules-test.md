# Firebase Firestore Rules Issue

## The Problem
Your form is getting stuck on "Sending..." because **Firestore security rules are blocking the write operation**.

## The Solution
You need to update your Firestore security rules to allow writes to the 'interest' collection.

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `kindlyroe-website`
3. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**

### Step 2: Update the Rules
Replace the current rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to the 'interest' collection
    match /interest/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
    
    // Deny all other access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Publish the Rules
Click **"Publish"** to save the new rules.

## Alternative: Test Rules (Less Secure)
If you want to test quickly, you can temporarily use these rules (NOT for production):

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Why This Happens
- By default, Firestore rules deny all access
- Your form tries to write to `/interest` collection
- Firestore blocks the write with a permission error
- The error is silent, so the form just hangs

## Testing
After updating the rules:
1. Refresh your website
2. Try submitting the form
3. Check the browser console - you should see success messages
4. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Data to see the submitted data
