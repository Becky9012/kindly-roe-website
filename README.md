## Local development

## CI/CD

This repo deploys with **GitHub Actions** using **Google Workload Identity Federation**, so there are no JSON keys or Firebase tokens.

- **Branch that deploys to production**: `main`
- **Firebase project**: `kindlyroe-website`
- **Service account**: `ci-deployer@kindlyroe-website.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml`

The workflow:

1. Checks out the repo
2. Authenticates to Google Cloud using WIF
3. Installs Node 20 and the Firebase CLI
4. Builds the website
5. Builds functions if present
6. Deploys to Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions

Run it by pushing to `main` or using **Actions** ‚Üí **Run workflow**.

## Deployment

### Automatic (recommended)

Pushing to `main` will deploy to:

- **Hosting**: `kindlyroe-website`
- **Functions**: Gen 2 in `europe-west2` (if present)

You will see the run in GitHub at **Actions**.

### Manual (for emergencies only)

You can still deploy from your machine if logged in.

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting --project kindlyroe-website
firebase deploy --only functions --project kindlyroe-website
```

### Common fixes

**Permission denied on deploy**  
Ensure `ci-deployer@kindlyroe-website.iam.gserviceaccount.com` has roles: `firebase.admin`, `cloudfunctions.admin`, `run.admin`, `artifactregistry.reader`, and `iam.serviceAccountUser` on `${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`.

**API not enabled**  
Enable once in Cloud Shell:
`cloudfunctions.googleapis.com`, `run.googleapis.com`, `artifactregistry.googleapis.com`, `cloudbuild.googleapis.com`, `eventarc.googleapis.com`, `hosting.googleapis.com`.

**Wrong project or site**  
Deploy with explicit flags:
`firebase deploy --project kindlyroe-website`
and if you have multiple sites:
`--site YOUR_SITE_ID`.
